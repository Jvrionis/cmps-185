\opening{Autopilot SW Infrastructure team,}

\noindent My name is James Vrionis. Truly captivated by Teslas 
statement to the world, failure is not an option. I will be graduating 
from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) with Bachelor of 
Science in Computer Science. My interest in Tesla, including but not 
limited to, in specific but limited to, solving the Level 5 autonomy 
as it pertains to our current transportation system.

\noindent I have acquired sufficient skills in scripting languages, 
such as Perl, and shell able to utilize the powerful pattern 
matching tools they bring to the table. For the past 5 years 
I have used $C/C++$ extensively, enjoying capabilities not 
bound to overhead. A former Professor of mine would say, 
"You don't pay for what you don't use". Certainly, this will 
set me up to deliver high-quality systems that can be held to 
higher code of excellence, helping Tesla meet its ultimate goal: 
fully Autonomous Transportation systems.

\noindent An opportunity to join the Autopilot SW Infrastructure 
team and in order help dissolve our dependence on fossil fuels 
is a  purpose worth fighting for. I can be reached at 
$(555) 555-5555$ or via email at jvrionis@ucsc.edu. I look 
forward to a formal interview where my passion and qualifications 
may be seen first hand. I appreciate your consideration for this 
position.

\closing{Sincerely,}

% Practically, I don't have any unique experience in this field but I do
% possess a hunger to make this world a better place. If learning the
% ins and outs of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and the most 
% efficient way to implement this will help propel us to level 5 
% autonomy then I am committed to making it happen.
 
% \noindent I am going to be in Palo Alto, California for the next
